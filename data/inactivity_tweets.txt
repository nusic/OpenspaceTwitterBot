Nothing committed. These Swedes seems to not be working today
So no commit today? Well I guess you can't work wonders every day
These guys haven't committed anything today. Should we maybe fire them? At least one of them should go, I think.
Sometimes I think doubt they are actually working. Nothing has been committed today
Nope. No commits. I think I saw Kalle sleeping earlier. Erik was definitevily on Facebook
Nothing. Nada. Inget. Zzzzz...
Once again, nothing to report. Damn lazy Swedes...
